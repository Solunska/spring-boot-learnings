# Spring Boot Course

This repository is part of a comprehensive Spring Boot course aimed at building foundational knowledge in Spring Boot and related technologies. The course is structured into modules, each focusing on specific concepts and their practical implementation. By the end of the course, I will have developed complete real-time projects, including a Spring Boot REST API with full CRUD functionality and a Spring Boot MVC application leveraging Hibernate/JPA.
### **Course Description**
The course covers the following concepts:
- Spring Boot Core
